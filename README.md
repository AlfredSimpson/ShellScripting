# ShellScripting

A collection of shell scripts that I've used, built from scratch, or modified that didn't fit in specific repos. I'm relatively new to shell scripting, so this may consist of more junior level shell scripts. I typically create shell scripts specifically for small, invidualized purposes: CTFs, pulling files that follow sequences, etc.


## What to expect

I tend to create shell scripts for:
- [x] CTFs
- [x] Menial Tasks
- [x] Fun
- [x] Utilities
